The phone feature comfort, size,handling, Camera is very good & commendable but whereas the most important battery is concerned the back up of this phone is very poor.

There are some software bugs though and I hope they will be solved via software update. if you budget under 30k then this should be your choice and even if your budget is 35k and you are planning to buy OnePlus 6 then save 14k and go for POCO F1 base variant bcoz the difference between these 2 phones doesn't worths 14k.

Pavan Kumar,2,Could be way better,Overall product quality is fine at the price range the product comes. But I received defect device. Headphone jack is not working properly. I have tried with many headsets and it gives a noise which is similar to blank FM noise. I have never seen such issues in any phone till now. I have asked for a replacment but don't think it's a good buy as manufacturers compromised on many major issues which are very basic and promoting using fast processor. But just being fast won't be a doing everything.,3,3,"Sep, 2018"
Bhoomish Atha,4,Wonderful,The phone has few minor bugs like the play store drawer gets cut off and some where apps get cut due to notch.The Color based sorting also fails as it bring Gmail app to black Color and game grouping also does not work for some games.

But your representative didn't accept my old phone stating that there is some loss of body paint/colour on phone cover (mustard size 4-5 small circles). I had to pay the full exchange amount as I have already made the prepayment through cards. Good sales strategy..give discount on pre payment and decline exchange of old phone. Do you expected people would exchange a new phone to buy another..",0,0,"Oct, 2019"
