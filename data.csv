Ankit  Rao,1,Waste of money!,Worst phone with worst 5g,0,0,Today
Kishore Pandi,5,Awesome,Good(bought on 2021)and still(2023) working without any problem in performance and battery drains too fast,0,0,2 days ago
Avinash  Rao,1,Not recommended at all,Bought this device on August 2021. Running pretty well. Have heard some people get dead mother board issue but I am facing it.. Major drawback for today Jio 5G doesn't work in this device. Which is not expecting from poco flagship phone. Plus they always late to give security updates. If you want for gaming purpose buy it but not recommended for camera and connectivity.,0,1,11 days ago
